# ibm\_iam_user_policy

Import the details of an IAM (Identity and Access Management) user policy on IBM Bluemix as a read-only data source. You can then reference the fields of the data source in other resources within the same configuration using interpolation syntax.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "ibm_org" "ds_org" {
  org = "sample"
}

data "ibm_account" "ds_acc" {
  org_guid = "${data.ibm_org.ds_org.id}"
}

resource "ibm_iam_user_policy" "iam_policy" {
  account_guid = "${data.ibm_account.ds_acc.id}"
  ibm_id       = "user@example.com"
  roles        = ["viewer"]
  resources    = [{"service_name" = "sample-service", "service_instance" = ["1refjnjb-vr4-vverr"]}]
}

data "ibm_iam_user_policy" "testacc_iam_policies" {
  account_guid = "${data.ibm_account.ds_acc.id}"
  ibm_id = "${ibm_iam_user_policy.iam_policy.ibm_id}"
}

```
